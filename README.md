![Io rotating on it's axis!](assets/io.gif)

`dorito` is an image reconstruction framework designed to interface with [`amigo`](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/amigo), an end-to-end differentiable forward-modelling pipeline for analysing data from the Aperture Masking Interferometer (AMI) observing mode of the *James Webb Space Telescope* (JWST).

Seen in the gif above are five successive images of Jupiter's moon Io that have been deconvolved with `dorito`, with the moon's axial rotation clearly visible. The right image shows the expected positions of known volcanic features on Io's hellscape of a surface!

## Documentation...?
THere is one example notebook here showing the reconstruction of Io in the image plane.

We are working hard to more create documentation and example notebooks to share with the community here. Thank you for your patience, and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or queries. You can reach me (Max) at
