# dorito

![Io rotating on it's axis!](assets/io.gif)

`dorito` is an image reconstruction framework designed to interface with [`amigo`](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/amigo), an end-to-end differentiable forward-modelling pipeline for analysing data from the Aperture Masking Interferometer (AMI) observing mode of the *James Webb Space Telescope* (JWST).

Seen in the gif above are five successive images of Jupiter's moon Io that have been deconvolved with `dorito`, with the moon's axial rotation clearly visible. The right image shows the expected positions of known volcanic features on Io's hellscape of a surface!

Please refer to our publications for more detail: [amigo paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09806), [dorito paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10924).
